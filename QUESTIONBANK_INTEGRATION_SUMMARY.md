## Overview
Successfully integrated the UIUQuestionBank folder with the Resources page, allowing students to browse and view past exam papers alongside user-uploaded resources.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. **student/api/resources.php** (Backend API)
**Location**: Line 112-300

**Changes Made**:
- Modified `getAllResources()` function to include question bank items
- Added `getQuestionBankResources()` function that:
  - Scans `UIUQuestionBank/question/` folder recursively
  - Matches course codes with database
  - Extracts trimester info from filenames (e.g., `CSE3521_Mid_241.pdf`)
  - Returns formatted resource objects with:
    - `resource_id`: `qb_` + MD5 hash of file path
    - `source_type`: `'questionbank'`
    - `category_id`: 2 (Past Papers)
    - `file_path`: Relative path to PDF
- Added `extractTrimesterFromFilename()` helper function

**File Naming Pattern**:
```
{COURSE_CODE}_{ExamType}_{Trimester}.pdf
Example: CSE3521_Mid_241.pdf
```

---

### 2. **student/resources.php** (Frontend Interface)
**Location**: Multiple sections

**Changes Made**:

#### A. Search Enhancement (Line 1149-1210)
- Added `matchesCourseAbbreviation()` function
- Supports abbreviation matching:
  - "DBMS" matches "Database Management Systems"
  - "OOP" matches "Object Oriented Programming"
  - "DS" matches "Data Structures"
- Algorithm: Extracts first letters from each word and compares

#### B. Filter UI (Line 748-770)
- Added "Question Bank" button in Special Filters section:
```html
<button class="filter-chip" data-special="questionbank">
    <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>
    Question Bank
</button>
```

#### C. Filter Logic (Line 1119-1125)
- Updated `filterResources()` to handle `'questionbank'` filter
- Shows only question bank items when filter is active

#### D. View Functions (Line 1375, 1454, 1607)
- Updated `viewResource()` calls to pass file path
- Updated onclick handlers for PDF viewing

#### E. Viewer Integration (Line 2061-2068)
- Modified `viewResource()` function to handle both sources:
  - Question bank: Passes `source=questionbank` and `path` parameter
  - Uploaded: Passes `source=uploaded`

---

### 3. **student/viewer.php** (PDF Viewer)
**Location**: Line 16-115

**Changes Made**:

#### A. Source Detection (Line 16-18)
```php
$resource_id = $_GET['id'] ?? '';
$source_type = $_GET['source'] ?? 'uploaded';
```

#### B. Question Bank Handler (Line 20-79)
- Validates resource ID format (`qb_*`)
- Security check: Ensures path is within `UIUQuestionBank/question/`
- Extracts metadata from filename
- Fetches course name from database
- Creates resource array compatible with existing UI

#### C. View Tracking (Line 117-137)
- Only tracks views for uploaded resources
- Skips view tracking for question bank items

#### D. Download Links (Line 500-530)
- Question bank: Direct download link
- Uploaded: API endpoint for download
- Hides bookmark/like for question bank items

#### E. Delete Button (Line 540-545)
- Only shows for user's own uploaded resources
- Never shows for question bank items

---

## New Features

### 1. **Question Bank Scanning**
- Automatically scans `UIUQuestionBank/question/` folder
- Finds all course folders (e.g., CSE3521, BUS1101, ENG1002)
- Discovers PDFs in `/mid/` and `/final/` subfolders
- Matches with courses database for full course names

### 2. **Abbreviation Search**
Search by abbreviations now works:
- "DBMS" finds "Database Management Systems"
- "AI" finds "Artificial Intelligence"
- "OOP" finds "Object Oriented Programming"
- "DS" finds "Data Structures"

### 3. **Question Bank Filter**
- New special filter button in UI
- Shows only question bank items when clicked
- Works alongside category filters

### 4. **Integrated Viewer**
- Seamless viewing of both uploaded and question bank PDFs
- Same WebViewer experience for all PDFs
- Question bank items show "UIU Question Bank" as uploader
- Direct download links for question bank PDFs

---

## Database Integration

### Course Matching
The system matches question bank folders with database courses:
```sql
SELECT course_id, course_code, course_name 
FROM courses 
WHERE REPLACE(course_code, ' ', '') = ?
```

**Note**: Database stores codes with spaces (`CSE 3521`), folders have no spaces (`CSE3521`)

## Resource Object Structure

### Question Bank Item
```json
{
    "resource_id": "qb_a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
    "title": "CSE3521 Mid Exam (241)",
    "course_code": "CSE3521",
    "course_name": "Operating Systems",
    "resource_type": "file",
    "file_type": "application/pdf",
    "file_path": "UIUQuestionBank/question/CSE3521/mid/CSE3521_Mid_241.pdf",
    "category_id": 2,
    "category_name": "Past Papers",
    "student_name": "UIU Question Bank",
    "source_type": "questionbank",
    "exam_type": "Mid",
    "trimester": "241",
    "created_at": "2025-10-17",
    "views_count": 0,

    ...
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Question Bank Resources
1. **Path Validation**: Only allows paths starting with `UIUQuestionBank/question/`
2. **No Modifications**: Question bank items cannot be liked, bookmarked, or deleted
3. **No View Tracking**: Views not tracked (no database writes)
4. **Read-Only**: Users can only view and download

### Uploaded Resources
1. **Ownership Check**: Only owner can delete
2. **View Tracking**: Counted in database
3. **Social Features**: Can be liked and bookmarked
4. **API Download**: Goes through API for tracking

---

## Performance Notes

### Folder Scanning
- Scans UIUQuestionBank folder on every API call
- Currently no caching (acceptable for ~30-40 courses)
- If performance becomes an issue, consider:
  - Caching results in session
  - Using a separate database table
  - Implementing file modification time checks

### Database Queries
- One query per course folder to get course name
- Uses prepared statements for security
- Queries are simple and fast (indexed on course_code)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Caching**: Store question bank scan results
2. **Admin Panel**: Manage question bank uploads
3. **Version Control**: Track when papers were updated
4. **Statistics**: Track most viewed question papers
5. **Solutions**: Add support for solution PDFs
6. **Preview**: Generate PDF thumbnails
7. **Batch Download**: Download all papers for a course
8. **Bookmarking**: Allow bookmarking question bank items (requires DB schema change)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No question bank items appear
**Solution**: 
- Check if UIUQuestionBank/question/ folder exists
- Verify PDFs are in correct structure (mid/final subfolders)
- Check filenames match pattern: `{COURSE}_Mid_{TRIMESTER}.pdf`

### Issue: Course name shows as "Question Paper"
**Solution**:
- Course code in folder name doesn't match database
- Check spaces in course code (CSE3521 vs CSE 3521)
- Add course to database if missing

### Issue: PDF won't open in viewer
**Solution**:
- Check file path in browser network tab
- Verify file exists at specified path
- Check WebViewer license key

### Issue: Search not finding abbreviations
**Solution**:
- Ensure course name has multiple words
- Abbreviation must match first letters
- Try searching full course name instead

## Code Snippets

### Scan Question Bank Folder
```php
function getQuestionBankResources($conn) {
    $resources = [];
    $basePath = '../../UIUQuestionBank/question/';
    
    if (!is_dir($basePath)) {
        return $resources;
    }
    
    $courseFolders = array_diff(scandir($basePath), ['.', '..']);
    
    foreach ($courseFolders as $folder) {
        $coursePath = $basePath . $folder;
        if (!is_dir($coursePath)) continue;
        
        // Check mid folder
        $midPath = $coursePath . '/mid';
        if (is_dir($midPath)) {
            $midFiles = glob($midPath . '/*.pdf');
            foreach ($midFiles as $file) {
                $resources[] = createQuestionBankResource($file, $folder, 'Mid', $conn);
            }
        }
        
        // Check final folder
        $finalPath = $coursePath . '/final';
        if (is_dir($finalPath)) {
            $finalFiles = glob($finalPath . '/*.pdf');
            foreach ($finalFiles as $file) {
                $resources[] = createQuestionBankResource($file, $folder, 'Final', $conn);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $resources;
}
```

### Match Abbreviation
```javascript
function matchesCourseAbbreviation(courseName, searchTerm) {
    if (!courseName) return false;
    
    // Extract first letters from course name
    const words = courseName.split(/\s+/);
    const abbreviation = words.map(w => w.charAt(0).toUpperCase()).join('');
    
    return abbreviation.includes(searchTerm.toUpperCase());
}
```
